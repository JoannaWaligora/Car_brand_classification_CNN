# Car_brand_classification_CNN
The project aims to classify photos featuring the logos of eight car brands: Hyundai, Lexus, Mazda, Mercedes, Opel, Skoda, Toyota, and Volkswagen.
Several models based on convolutional neural networks were tested, creating new models and building on existing models (VGG16) downloaded from the keras library (transfer learning).
The data used for the project was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/volkandl/car-brand-logos/data). There were several errors in the data, so the incorrect photos were moved to the correct folders or deleted. An additional folder was created with validation data.
The model comparison and conclusions can be found in the Car_brand_classification.ipynb file.
